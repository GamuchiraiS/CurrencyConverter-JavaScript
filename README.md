# CurrencyConverter-JavaScript

Write an application, using JavaScript, which allows for the conversion of a specified amount from one currency, to another. Write your program to allow for conversion between South African Rands (ZAR) and US Dollars (USD) using the current exchange rate at the time that you write your program.

Ask the user for the amount they want to convert, and to specify if they are converting from ZAR to USD, or from USD to ZAR. Then calculate and display the amount in the target currency
